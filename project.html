        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          You will come up with an idea to measure, build, or improve a storage system component, get it approved
          by the instructor, and implement it over the course of the semester. The project is designed to give you
          hands-on experience with storage systems and allow you to explore a topic of your interest in depth. This
          is an <strong>individual project</strong> that encourages the use of AI for both brainstorming and coding
          assistance. The
          final deliverables include a short report and a presentation to the class. Your presentation will be
          peer-evaluated and your report will be evaluated by the instructor and TA. The project is worth half of
          your final grade.
        </p>

        <div><strong>Objectives:</strong></div>
        <ul>
          <li>Apply concepts learned in class to a real-world problem</li>
          <li>Gain experience with systems programming and performance evaluation</li>
          <li>Deep dive into a specific area of storage systems</li>
          <li>Develop skills in technical writing and presentation</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="subsection"><strong>Team Policy:</strong> Projects must be done individually with no teams

        <h1>Grading Criteria</h1>
        <p>
          Project grades will be based on the quality of the proposal, implementation, evaluation, final report,
          and presentation, using the detailed criteria below. The grade primarily reflects the <em>effort</em> and
          <em>rigor</em> you bring to the project. While novelty is considered in the evaluation, it is not heavily
          weighted.
          Accordingly, an idea that does not succeed will not hurt
          your grade if you demonstrate a solid understanding of why it does not work. Likewise,
          engineering-focused or measurement-oriented projects can also earn high marks when they show strong
          execution, sound analytical reasoning and useful insights.
