          <p>If you feel you deserved a better grade on an assignment, you may send an email to your TA and instructor
            within 3 days after the grades are released. Your request should briefly summarize why you feel the original
            grade was unfair. We will reevaluate your assignment as soon as possible, and then issue a decision. Note
            that any regrade request may also lead to a lower grade if we find other issues with your submission.</p>

          <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Attending Guest Speakers' Lectures</h2>
          <p>
            In the second half of the class, we have two invited speakers. Our guest speakers make a significant effort
            to come lecture for us, so (both to show our appreciation and to continue attracting interesting speakers)
            we
            do not want them lecturing to a largely empty room. As such, we encourage students to attend these lectures
            live, and participate in Q&A.
            The guest lectures will account for half of the participation credit.

            <li><strong>Course feedback:</strong> Any constructive feedback and suggestions that improve the class can

        <div class="subsection">
          <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">AI Use Policy</h2>
          <p>The use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) is <strong>encouraged</strong>. We also provide free
            coding agent service for all students in this course.
            We will discuss this during the first class. Please contact the instructor if you missed the class.
            You can use AI tools for learning new knowledge, coding assistance, language polishing, and
            problem-solving. However, all submitted work must be your own. You
            should <emph>NEVER</emph> use AI to write your project report. <strong>You must disclose any use of AI tools
              in all submissions. Creative use of AI tools will receive extra credit.</strong> Misuse of AI tools, such
            as submitting AI-generated report as your own work without proper attribution, will be treated as a
            violation of the academic integrity policy.</p>
          <p>While we encourage the use of AI tools, please be aware of their limitations.
            AI tools can sometimes produce incorrect or misleading information, so it is important to critically
            evaluate any content generated by AI. Always double-check facts, code, and references provided by AI tools.
            You are responsible for understanding and verifying the accuracy of all content in your submission.</p>

          <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Attendance Policy and Laptop Use Policy</h2>
          <p>We highly recommend attending lectures in person to fully benefit from the course.
            We may take attendance silently without notification to calculate participation score.
            Laptops and other electronic devices are not forbidden but discouraged during lectures.
            Please avoid distractions during lectures to maintain a conducive learning environment for everyone.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Academic Integrity</h2>
          <p>All work submitted must be your own. Plagiarism, cheating, or any form of academic dishonesty will result
            in severe penalties, including failure of the course. Offense will be reported to the academic integrity
            office.</p>

          <p>We are committed to doing what we can to work for equity and to create an inclusive learning environment
            that
            actively values the diversity of backgrounds, identities, and experiences of everyone in CS2640. We also
            know
            that we will sometimes make missteps. If you notice some way that we could do better, we hope that you will
            let us know about it.</p>

          <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Auditing the Course</h2>
          <p>In general we are happy to have auditors if they are a member of the Harvard community (students, visitors,
            staff, and families).
            However, please send an email to the instructor in advance to discuss your interest in auditing the course.
