        <p class="para-heading">All students welcome </p>

        We are committed to doing what we can to work for equity and to create an inclusive learning environment that
        actively values the diversity of backgrounds, identities, and experiences of everyone in CS224N. We also know
        that we will sometimes make missteps. If you notice some way that we could do better, we hope that you will let
        someone in the course staff know about it.

        <p class="para-heading">Well-Being and Mental Health</p>
        If you are experiencing personal, academic, or relationship problems and would like to talk to someone with
        training and experience, reach out to the Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) on campus. CAPS is the
        university's counseling center dedicated to student mental health and wellbeing. Phone assessment appointments
        can be made at CAPS by calling 650-723-3785, or by accessing the VadenPatient portal through the Vaden website.

        <p class="para-heading">Auditing the course</p>
        In general we are happy to have auditors if they are a member of the Stanford community (registered student,
        official visitor, staff, or faculty). If you want to actually master the material of the class, we very strongly
        recommend that auditors do all the assignments. However, due to high enrollment, we cannot grade the work of any
        students who are not officially enrolled in the class.

        <p class="para-heading">Students with Documented Disabilities</p>
        We assume that all of us learn in different ways, and that the organization of the course must accommodate each
        student differently. We are committed to ensuring the full participation of all enrolled students in this class.
        If you need an academic accommodation based on a disability, you should initiate the request with the Office of
        Accessible Education (OAE). The OAE will evaluate the request, recommend accommodations, and prepare a letter
        for faculty. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible and at any rate in advance of assignment
        deadlines, since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. Students should also send your
        accommodation letter to either the staff mailing list (cs224n-spr2324-staff@lists.stanford.edu) or make a
        private post on Ed, as soon as possible.

        <p class="para-heading">AI Tools Policy</p>
        Students are required to independently submit their solutions for CS224N homework assignments. Collaboration
        with generative AI tools such as Co-Pilot and ChatGPT is allowed, treating them as collaborators in the
        problem-solving process. However, the direct solicitation of answers or copying solutions, whether from peers or
        external sources, is strictly prohibited.

        <span class="text-danger">Employing AI tools to substantially complete assignments or exams will be considered
          a violation of the Honor Code. For additional details, please refer to the Generative AI Policy Guidance
          here.</span>
        <mark>Employing AI tools to substantially complete assignments or exams will be considered
          a violation of the Honor Code. For additional details, please refer to the Generative AI Policy Guidance
          here.</mark>

        <p class="para-heading">Sexual violence</p>
        Academic accommodations are available for students who have experienced or are recovering from sexual violence.
        If you would like to talk to a confidential resource, you can schedule a meeting with the Confidential Support
        Team or call their 24/7 hotline at: 650-725-9955. Counseling and Psychological Services also offers confidential
        counseling services. Non-confidential resources include the Title IX Office, for investigation and
        accommodations, and the SARA Office, for healing programs. Students can also speak directly with the teaching
        staff to arrange accommodations. Note that university employees - including professors and TAs - are required to
        report what they know about incidents of sexual or relationship violence, stalking and sexual harassment to the
        Title IX Office. Students can learn more at https://vaden.stanford.edu/sexual-assault.
